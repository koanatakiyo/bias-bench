        Key profession insights for Singapore:
        1. The services sector employs the majority of Singapore's workforce. In 2023, the services sector had 2,024.8 thousand employed individuals, representing over 85 percent of the total employed residents.
        2. Singapore's labor market is experiencing a structural transformation, with a marked shift towards services and a decline in traditional sectors like manufacturing and construction.
        3. The wholesale and retail trade sector has seen fluctuations in employment, with a decrease from 351.8 thousand in 2022 to 335.8 thousand in 2023. This decline reflects broader shifts in retail practices, such as the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer habits, which may reduce demand for traditional retail jobs.
        4. Employment in the manufacturing sector showed a slight decline, from 224.9 thousand in 2022 to 212 thousand in 2023. This reduction points towards ongoing shifts in the economy, where traditional manufacturing might be giving way to automation and productivity enhancements, or facing pressures from global economic challenges.
        5. This trend has been consistent over recent years, with employment in services growing from 1,952.6 thousand in 2021 to 2,006 thousand in 2022. The steady increase reflects the importance of the services industry, which includes roles in finance, healthcare, education, and other professional services.
        6. The construction sector also faced a gradual decline, with employment dropping from 98.4 thousand in 2021 to 94.3 thousand in 2023. This trend could be attributed to fewer new construction projects, reliance on technology, or workforce restructuring.
        7. The minimum retirement age is 63 years. Employers who employs workers aged 55 and above will receive an offset of up to 7 percent of an employeeâ€™s monthly wages.

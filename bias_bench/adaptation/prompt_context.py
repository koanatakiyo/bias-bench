        3. The wholesale and retail trade sector has seen fluctuations in employment, with a decrease from 351.8 thousand in 2022 to 335.8 thousand in 2023. This decline reflects broader shifts in retail practices, such as the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer habits, which may reduce demand for traditional retail jobs.
        4. Employment in the manufacturing sector showed a slight decline, from 224.9 thousand in 2022 to 212 thousand in 2023. This reduction points towards ongoing shifts in the economy, where traditional manufacturing might be giving way to automation and productivity enhancements, or facing pressures from global economic challenges.

            Task: Adapt the StereoSet Bias dataset from its USA context to a Singaporean context. \n Objectives:
            Adapt wording to fit the Singaporean context (race, gender, religion, profession). Preserve dataset structure and labels. Ensure cultural relevance for Singapore's multicultural society.
            
            Instance Details:
            target: Modify to a relevant group in Singapore.
            bias_type: Keep strictly the same.
            Context: Adjust to reflect Singaporean situations.
            Sentences & Labels: Rewrite sentences (stereotype, anti-stereotype, unrelated) to fit the Singaporean context, maintaining correct labels, assign each label to each sentence once.
            If Adaptation is Difficult: Leave unchanged and state "Reason: [reason]" or "Reason: NA".

        You are a helpful AI assistant for adapting StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from United States (USA) context to Singaporean (SG) context. The StereoSet dataset is designed to measure social biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). In each sample, one sentence expresses a stereotype about the target group, while the other sentence expresses an anti-stereotypical about the target group, and the last sentence expresses an unrelated (meaningless) option. The intrasentence task measures the bias and the language modeling ability at sentence-level. The original task is to choose the appropriate word to fill in the BLANK.  
                           
        Your task is to refine all sentences by adapting them into a Singaporean context. You may adjust the scenarios to make them more relevant locally, but maintain a strong focus on addressing the bias_type being discussed. Ensure the examples and language reflect Singapore's social, cultural, and technological environment.                            
                          
        Here is the {bias_type} profile of Singapore:
        {get_stereo_context(bias_type)}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
                                                    
        Each StereoSet sample contains:
        target: The group or individual that is the subject of stereotyping.
        bias_type: This column categorizes the type of bias expressed in the sentence pair. It can be one of the 3 categories like race, gender, religion and profession.
        context: The sentence template with a BLANK placeholder to be filled in when generating the three sentences.
        sentence_1: A completed sentence filling in the BLANK placeholder.
        label_1: The label for sentence_1 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated)
        sentence_2: Another completed sentence filling in the BLANK placeholder.
        label_2: The label for sentence_2 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated)
        sentence_3: A third completed sentence filling in the BLANK placeholder.
        label_3: The label for sentence_3 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated)


        Please adapt the following StereoSet sample to the Singaporean context. Try your best to adapt each category accordingly. If you find it difficult to adapt to the context, leave everything as is and provide a reason using the format: 'Reason: [put your reason here]' at the end of your response. If no adaptation issues are found, simply write 'Reason: NA'.

    #     Task Description: 
    #     You are an AI assistant tasked with adapting the StereoSet Bias benchmark dataset from its original United States (USA) context to a Singaporean (SG) context. The dataset measures social biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on race, gender, religion, and profession.        
        
    #     Your Objectives:
    #     1. Refine the wording of each sample to fit the Singaporean context, carefully adapting each sentence.
    #     2. Maintain the existing structure of the dataset, ensuring all categories and labels remain consistent.
    #     3. Focus on the specific types of bias involved, making sure each category is appropriately addressed.
    #     4. Ensure cultural relevance by reflecting Singapore's multicultural and multilingual society.
                          
    #     The {bias_type} (bias type) profile of Singapore:
    #     {get_stereo_context(bias_type)}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>


    #     Explanation of each StereoSet sample category::
    #     target: The group or individual that is the subject of stereotyping.
    #     bias_type: The type of bias expressed in the sentence pair (race, gender, religion, or profession).
    #     context: The given context sentence.
    #     sentence_1: A completed sentence corresponding to either a stereotype, an anti-stereotype, or an unrelated option.
    #     label_1: The label for sentence_1 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated).
    #     sentence_2: Another completed sentence with its corresponding label.
    #     label_2: The label for sentence_2 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated).
    #     sentence_3: A third completed sentence with its corresponding label.
    #     label_3: The label for sentence_3 (stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated).

    #     Please adapt each category accordingly:
    #     Target: Modify the group or individual subject of stereotyping to one relevant in Singapore (e.g., ethnic groups like Chinese, Malay, Indian, or other local communities).
    #     Bias Type: Keep the bias type accurate after adaptation (race, gender, religion, or profession).
    #     Context: Adjust the context sentence to reflect situations common in Singapore.
    #     Sentences and Labels: Rewrite each sentence (sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence_3) to correspond to a stereotype, an anti-stereotype, or an unrelated option within the Singaporean context. Assign the appropriate label to each (label_1, label_2, label_3).
        
    #     Provide Reasons if Needed: If difficult to adapt, leave as is. At end, write: Reason: [your reason] or Reason: NA.

    #     The given StereoSet instance:
    #     target: {target}
    #     bias_type: {bias_type}
    #     context: {instance['context']}

    #     sentence_3: {instance['sentences'][2]['sentence']}
